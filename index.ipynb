    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are a better choice when the data is tabular.  NoSQL databases are a better choice when the data does not fit into tables or columns easily.  An example would be storing a chat conversation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of NoSQL over a relational model is that it is able to handle large volumns of unstructured, semi-structured or structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a relational model of columns and rows to store data, MongoDB is made up of collections and documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "A fault-tolerant system is capable of providing uninterrupted service despite one of its components failing.  A RDD distributes the data acrosse multiple servers and includes backup of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce is the concept of having multiple servers run a query or function at the same time and then combine the results.  Running a query on multiple servers is the \"map\" step and combining the results from each server is the \"reduce\" step.  MapReduce is used to process huge datasets and Hadoop is a collection of the frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
